  "answer": "Here is a detailed answer to the question \"What is 2+2?\":\n\n<h3>What is 2+2?</h3>\n\n<p>The mathematical expression \"2+2\" is a simple addition problem that asks what the sum of the numbers 2 and 2 is. In other words, it is asking what number results when you add the quantity 2 to the quantity 2.</p>\n\n<p>To solve this problem, we can use our knowledge of basic arithmetic. Addition is one of the fundamental mathematical operations, where we combine two or more numbers to get a new, larger number.</p>\n\n<p>When we add 2 and 2 together, the result is 4. This is because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>2</strong> represents a quantity of 2 units.</li>\n  <li><strong>2</strong> also represents a quantity of 2 units.</li>\n  <li>When we add these two quantities together, we get a total of 4 units.</li>\n  <li>Therefore, the answer to the expression \"2+2\" is <strong>4</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In summary, 2+2=4 because when you combine two quantities of 2, the total amount is 4. This is a basic arithmetic fact that is fundamental to mathematics and can be easily verified through simple counting or using visual aids like blocks or fingers.</p>"

This lack of transparency makes it difficult to hold AI developers and users accountable for the impacts of their systems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Algorithmic Bias:</strong> AI models can perpetuate or amplify societal biases present in the data used to train them. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, especially in high-stakes applications like hiring or lending decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety and Reliability:</strong> Errors or malfunctions in AI-powered engineering systems could have serious consequences.

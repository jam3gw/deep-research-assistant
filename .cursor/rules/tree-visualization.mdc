# Tree Visualization Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for the tree visualization component of the personal-assistant project.

## HTML Content Handling

When working with the tree visualization component, follow these guidelines for handling HTML content:

1. **HTML Escaping**: Always escape HTML content in node questions and answers to prevent rendering issues
   - Use appropriate escaping functions when inserting user-generated or API-returned content
   - Be particularly careful with content that might contain HTML tags

2. **CSS Styling**: Maintain consistent styling across all nodes
   - Use the defined CSS classes for different node types (question-node, answer-node)
   - Do not add inline styles directly to node content

3. **Source References**: Always include source references in a consistent format
   - Sources should be displayed in the `.sources` container
   - Each source should include both title and URL when available
   - Sources should be clickable links that open in a new tab

## Tree Structure

The question tree should maintain a consistent structure:

```
Root Question (Level 0)
├── Answer
│   └── Sources
├── Sub-Question 1 (Level 1)
│   ├── Answer
│   │   └── Sources
│   └── Sub-Sub-Question (Level 2)
│       ├── Answer
│       │   └── Sources
└── Sub-Question 2 (Level 1)
    └── Answer
        └── Sources
```

## Debugging Tree Issues

When debugging tree visualization issues:

1. Check for missing or undefined properties in the node objects
2. Verify that HTML content is properly escaped
3. Inspect the generated HTML for structural issues
4. Ensure CSS styles are being properly applied
5. Verify that the toggle functionality works correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### HTML Content Breaking Layout

If HTML tags in answers are breaking the layout:
- Ensure content is properly escaped or sanitized
- Consider using a dedicated HTML sanitizer library

### Missing Sources

If sources are not displaying:
- Verify the sources array exists in the node object
- Check that sources have both title and URL properties
- Ensure the sources CSS is properly defined

### Inconsistent Node Depth

If node depths appear inconsistent:
- Check the `parent_depth` parameter is being passed correctly
- Verify the depth calculation logic in `render_interactive_node_html`
- Ensure each node has a valid `depth` property
